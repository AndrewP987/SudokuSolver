# SudokuSolver
 
 Sudoku is a very popular game that has been around for decades. For some people, the game is very hard to play. For that reason, and well practice reasons, I have created this sudoku solver app. In the sudokuProblems directory, there are already 2 puzzles that you can look at and maybe solve on your own before using the app to do so for you. To add another puzzle, just make another .txt file and copy the format of the other puzzles. 
 
 This app uses Backtracking, Java, and Interfaces. In the Computer Science world, Backtracking is a technique that is used to solve problems recursively by trying to build a solution. It implments a strategy called pruning in order to quickly discard invalid configurations that were made when making new successors to such configuration.
